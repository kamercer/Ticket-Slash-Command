This slash command takes in a city as an argument and returns events in the area that are happening on the current day, have available seats and are under 100 Dollars.
It uses the SeatGeek api to look up the venues.
The command is "/Ticket [Search]".
Selecting an event will return a link to the event

I used this project, https://github.com/mixmaxhq/giphy-example-slash-command, to assist me with this project.
