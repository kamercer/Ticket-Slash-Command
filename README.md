This slash command takes in a city as an argument and returns events in the area that are happening on the current day and are under 100 Dollars.
It uses the SeatGeek api to look up events that are in the city, have available seats and are less than 100 dollars
The command is "/Ticket [Search]".

I used this project, https://github.com/mixmaxhq/giphy-example-slash-command, to assist me with this project.
